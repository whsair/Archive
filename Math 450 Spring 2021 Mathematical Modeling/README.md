# CMPSC 448: Machine Learning and Algorithmic AI


Through the semester we will introduce mathematical modeling, i.e., the use of mathematical ideas and tools and the construction of mathematical equations and formulations to study the natural world. Particular emphasis will be placed on open-ended problems: the process of creating a mathematical model from a physical, biological, or social science scenario. We will focus on some of the heuristic, intuitive, and systematic mathematical approaches used in making models. Particular emphasis will be placed on framing problems, the process of creating a mathematical model starting from a physical, biological, or social scenarios and data, developing the associated mathematical theory, and applying existing methods and algorithms. Once a model has been developed, we will use a combination of analysis and computational experimentation to determine its properties and relevance - and to make predictions. Often the first modeling attempt is unsatisfactory; it may not adequately explain observations, or its predictions are not borne out... so we go back and tweak the model or start from scratch! It is the goal of this course to engage you in this cycle.


Rough topics overview
We will aim to discuss these topics, but other interesting nuggets may also pop up!
