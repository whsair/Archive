# CMPSC 461: Programming Language Concepts Fall 2019
The goal of this course is to explore fundamental principles and paradigms of pro-gramming languages.  We will not focus on any one particular language, but rather we will studyfeatures found in many different languages and examine how they work and how they interact witheach other.  We will examine different programming paradigms, including imperative, functional,and object-oriented.

## HW2
- **scheme**
- For this assignment, you need to submit your solution as one single file to Canvas.  You may NOT use anyof Scheme’s imperative features (assignment/loops) or anything else not covered in class.  Define auxiliaryfunctions where appropriate.  While you may use whatever implementation of Scheme you like, we highlyrecommend using Petite Scheme (www.scheme.com) or repl.it (www.repl.it/languages/scheme). We will betesting your code on Petite scheme. For all problems, you can assume all inputs obey the types as specified in a problem. We have provided a test file “hw2-test.scm” on Canvas for your testing.
