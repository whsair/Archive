# CMPSC 221: Object Oriented Programming with Web-Based Applications

CMPSC 221 is the third course in the introductory programming sequence and begins by transitioning students from C++ to Java. It then proceeds with:
- Object-Oriented Programming: This unit builds upon the object-based programming learned in CMPSC 122 and introduces the students to more advanced concepts.
- Graphics and Graphical User Interfaces: This unit teaches students how to use Java's built-in drawing tools. In the process, the event-driven programming paradigm is introduced with an emphasis on creating applets that can be used on the web.
- Databases: Students begin by learning high-level concepts of relational databases and study the basics of SQL, emphasizing retrieving data from database tables. Students then learn how to incorporate database code in Java via Java DataBase Connectivity (JDBC) and create GUI front ends for databases driven by SQL
