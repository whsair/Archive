1. According to what Dr.Liu said in the lecture, Haar Cascade face detection set the region around both eyes as our key features.
If something covers our eyes such hair, Haar Cascade face detection model acts poorly.

2. Actually, I tricked with our program by using my hand to cover one of my eye then model just stopped working.

3. Potential application: In the movie industry, we can potential integrate Haar Cascade face detection model with the camera
   Moreover, in the facial recognition model, we can use Haar Cascade face detection model to get the location of the face then
   scan the facial information, extract particular facial feature and create a unique model.
