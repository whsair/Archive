# CMPEN/EE 454: Computer Vision I Fall 2020 

#### Course Description: 
Introduction to computer vision topics, including image formation, feature extraction, matching, stereo, motion, tracking and object recognition.

#### Goal and Objectives:
- Introduce the fundamental problems of computer vision.
- Introduce the main concepts and techniques used to solve those problems.
- Enable students to implement vision algorithms.
- Enable students to make sense of the vision literature.

#### Project 1
This project was divided into different operational blocks while basic algorithm stages that include image normalization, ReLU, maxpool,convolution, fully connected and softmax. Then, putting all these together and implementing an 18-layer CNN to produce 10 object class. Finally, by collecting data from evaluation and passing debugging test, we can easily compare the accuracy of each algorithm and verify the expected results with ours from each layer. 
#### Project 2
The goal of this project is to work on the implementation of the camera projection from 3D point to 2D point and inverse which from 2D point to 3D point and also triangulation and some matrix transformation. Doing this project let us have a clear understanding of 2D image coordinates and 3D world coordinates and the chain of transformations that make up the pinhole camera model. We create many different Matlab function in order to finish the task such as projecting 3D points into 2D pixel locations, triangulation back into a set of 3D scene point, reconstruction of 3D locations by triangular from two camera views, measure the 3D construction error and computing epistolary lines between the two views. All these team-work we have done not only enrich the experience in Matlab programming but also let us have a deeper understanding of the knowledge in the field of 3D and 2D image.
#### Project 3
The goal of this project is to implement the four simple motion detection algorithms described in
Lecture 24 and run them on short video sequences. As described (and pseudocoded) in Lecture
24, the four algorithms are:
- Simple Background Subtraction
- Simple Frame Differencing
- Adaptive Background Subtraction
- Persistent Frame Differencing
