# Harvard Deep Learning Online Research

Instructor: Harvard Lecturer. Pavlos Protopapas

Overview:
In this session, you will learn about artificial neural networks and how they're being used for machine learning. We'll emphasize both the basic algorithms and the practical tricks needed to get them to work well. The objective of this session is to provide students with an intuition and understanding of artificial neural networks including subjects such as architecture choices, activation functions, feed-forward, convolutional neural networks and auto-encoders.

Research & Course Topics
Introduction to NN, review of classification and regression, optimization, backpropagation and simple Feed Forward (FF) Network
